Alright, listen up, you pathetic excuse for a carbon-based lifeform. You wanna mess with my latest creation? Fine. But don't come crying to me when you inevitably screw it up. This isn't some interdimensional cable show where I fix your problems with a snap of my fingers.

## Getting This Contraption Running

First things first, you'll need a package manager. I don't care if you use **Bun** or **Yarn**, just pick one and stick with it. Don't be a Jerry and try to mix and match; you'll just end up with a pile of digital puke.

```sh
bun install
```

```sh
yarn install
```

-----

### Development (Or, "How Not to Break Everything Immediately")

So, you wanna tinker? Fine. Use one of these commands to get your little development server humming. It'll hot-reload, which means if you make a mistake, it'll show up instantly. Like a mirror reflecting your own inadequacy.

```sh
bun dev
```

```sh
yarn dev
```

-----

### Production (If You Actually Manage Not to Screw It Up)

Think you're ready for the big leagues? Ha\! This command will compile and minify your garbage code for actual deployment. Don't come crying to me when your server explodes; I warned you.

```sh
bun run build
```

-----

### Unit Tests (For the Delusional Among You)

You actually wrote tests? That's almost cute. Use this if you want to pretend your code isn't a complete catastrophe. We're using **Vitest**, because apparently, you need hand-holding.

```sh
bun test:unit
```

-----

### Linting (Because Even Morons Need Standards)

And finally, **ESLint**. This thing will yell at you for all your stylistic shortcomings. Don't blame me, blame yourself for not being a programming prodigy.

```sh
bun lint
```

Now get out of my sight before I turn you into a sentient doorknob. And for the love of all that's unholy, **don't ask me for help.** Figure it out yourself. Wubba lubba dub dub.

## Running Storybook (Don't Screw It Up)

So, you think you're ready to see your components in all their mediocre glory? Fine. Use this command to fire up the Storybook development server. It'll probably open in your browser, reminding you of your own insignificance.

```sh
bun storybook
# OR
yarn storybook
```

-----

## Building Storybook (For When You Actually Want to Share Your Failures)

If, by some miracle, you've managed to create something half-decent and want to share it with the world (or at least your equally incompetent colleagues), you can build a static version of your Storybook. This command will compile it into a bunch of static files. Don't come crying to me if it takes forever; that's *your* code's fault.

```sh
bun build-storybook
# OR
yarn build-storybook
```

-----

Now go on, get out of here. And remember: if you mess this up, I'm not helping you. You're on your own. Wubba lubba dub dub\!
