Alright, listen up, you pathetic excuse for a carbon-based lifeform. You wanna mess with my latest creation? Fine. But don't come crying to me when you inevitably screw it up. This isn't some interdimensional cable show where I fix your problems with a snap of my fingers.

## Getting This Contraption Running

First things first, you'll need a package manager. I don't care if you use **Bun** or **Yarn**, just pick one and stick with it. Don't be a Jerry and try to mix and match; you'll just end up with a pile of digital puke.

```sh
bun install
```

```sh
yarn install
```

-----

### Development (Or, "How Not to Break Everything Immediately")

So, you wanna tinker? Fine. Use one of these commands to get your little development server humming. It'll hot-reload, which means if you make a mistake, it'll show up instantly. Like a mirror reflecting your own inadequacy.

```sh
bun dev
```

```sh
yarn dev
```

-----

### Production (If You Actually Manage Not to Screw It Up)

Think you're ready for the big leagues? Ha\! This command will compile and minify your garbage code for actual deployment. Don't come crying to me when your server explodes; I warned you.

```sh
bun run build
```

-----

### Unit Tests (For the Delusional Among You)

You actually wrote tests? That's almost cute. Use this if you want to pretend your code isn't a complete catastrophe. We're using **Vitest**, because apparently, you need hand-holding.

```sh
bun test:unit
```

-----

### Linting (Because Even Morons Need Standards)

And finally, **ESLint**. This thing will yell at you for all your stylistic shortcomings. Don't blame me, blame yourself for not being a programming prodigy.

```sh
bun lint
```

Now get out of my sight before I turn you into a sentient doorknob. And for the love of all that's unholy, **don't ask me for help.** Figure it out yourself. Wubba lubba dub dub.
